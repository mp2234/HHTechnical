a short puzzle

Assumptions: 
* The user machine will be able to execute Java.
* The program will be executed from the command line, with the user providing N as a parameter.
* The program will be shipped compiled, ie the user will not be able to see the source
 
Removed from the shipped version is debug mode, enabled by passing in a second parameter "true". The functionality enabling it has been commented out.

Choices:
* Java was selected for familiarity and also because it was the primary choice listed in the prompt
* A hashmap was used to store computed values of secret() to reduce the computational overhead of an executing isAdditive for larger N's. The performance gain can be guessed at by looking at the ratio provided in debug mode.
